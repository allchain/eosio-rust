# Quick Start

In this quick-start tutorial we will create a simple EOSIO smart contract in Rust that accepts an account name and prints a greeting message.

Create a new Rust library:

```sh
cargo new hello --lib
```

Edit `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
{{#include ../../examples/hello/Cargo.toml}}
```

Edit `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,no_run,noplaypen
{{#include ../../examples/hello/src/lib.rs}}
```

Compile with the following command:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C link-args=-zstack-size=48000" \
cargo build --release -target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The smart contract should now be built at `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello.wasm`

## Deploying

Create a new file called `abi.json` (in future versions this will be automatically generated):

```json
{
  "version": "eosio::abi/1.0",
  "structs": [
    {
      "name": "hi",
      "base": "",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "name"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "hi",
      "type": "hi"
    }
  ]
}
```

Assuming you have `cleos` setup and have created the `hello` account:

```sh
cleos set abi hello abi.json
cleos set code hello target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello.wasm
```

## Say Hello

Finally, say hello:

```sh
cleos push action hello hi '["world"]' -p 'hello@active'
```

If all went well you should see `Hello, world` in the console. Otherwise, if the transaction was sent successfully but you don't see any output, you may need to use the `--contract-console` option with `nodeos`.
